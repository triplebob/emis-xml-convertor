# Changelog

## Latest Updates

### Export Filtering & UI Improvements - ADDED

**Enhanced Export Options:**
- **Export Filtering**: Clinical Codes and Medications tabs now include radio buttons to export:
  - All Codes (everything)
  - Only Matched (codes that found SNOMED mappings)
  - Only Unmatched (codes that failed to find mappings)
- **Live Export Count**: Shows "ðŸ“Š X of Y items selected for export" with real-time feedback
- **Smart Filenames**: Downloads get descriptive names (e.g., `clinical_codes_matched_20241212.csv`)

**User Interface Enhancements:**
- **Cancel Processing**: Added cancel button that replaces process button during execution
- **Collapsible Sidebar**: Performance Settings and Version Info are now collapsible for cleaner interface
- **Dynamic Help Text**: Processing strategy help text updates based on selection
- **Improved File Notifications**: File size information now appears as toast notifications instead of full-width bars

**User Benefit:** Users can now export exactly the data they need and have better control over long-running processes with a cleaner, more organized interface.

### Enhanced Analytics Dashboard - ADDED

- Color-coded performance indicators for quick assessment
- Export functionality for audit reports (JSON, text, CSV formats)
- Improved layout with better space utilization

### Interface Improvements - UPDATED
- Reorganized layout with cleaner header design and improved column structure
- Results section now spans full width for better viewing
- Toast notifications replace persistent success messages
- Better typography hierarchy with appropriately sized headings

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed duplicate medications appearing in multiple tabs
- Fixed EMIS internal codes being misclassified as medications
- Fixed status bar version information not displaying
- Fixed oversized metrics in analytics tab

### Clinical Codes Enhancement - ADDED

Now clinical codes display these essential columns:

**From XML:**

- **Include Children**: Shows if search is configured to include child codes (`<includeChildren>true</includeChildren>`)
- **Table Context**: Shows the source table container (e.g., MEDICATION_ISSUES)
- **Column Context**: Shows the column (e.g., DRUGCODE)

**From Lookup Table:**

- **Has Qualifier**: Shows if code has qualifier flag (can accept a numeric value as an additional search entity - for example blood pressure)
- **Is Parent**: Shows if code can have children (is compatible with Include Children)
- **Descendants**: Count of child codes that will be included if Include Children = True
- **Code Type**: Clinical code type (e.g., "Finding", "Procedure", etc.)

**User Benefit:**
Users now see the complete picture of how their search will behave and what codes will be included.

### Changelog System - ADDED

- **New Feature**: Added expandable "What's New" section in the app interface
- **Location**: Positioned below the XML upload section for easy discovery
- **Content**: Shows recent updates, fixes, and enhancements
- **Files**: Created `changelog.md` for detailed history and `changelog.py` for in-app display
- **User Benefit**: Users can quickly see latest improvements without checking external documentation

### Status Bar Version Information - FIXED

- **Problem**: Version information section not displaying despite valid JSON data being available
- **Root Cause**: Empty dictionary `{}` was evaluating to `False` in boolean context when version loading failed
- **Solution**: Enhanced JSON loading with robust error handling and improved boolean checking
- **Additional Fix**: Added UK date formatting and visual alignment improvements
- **Result**: Status bar now properly displays EMIS MKB Release, SNOMED Clinical Terms Version, and Extract Date
- **User Benefit**: Users can now see exactly which version of the lookup table they're using

### EMIS Internal Codes Misclassification - FIXED

- **Problem**: EMIS internal status codes (like "C" for "Current") appearing in medications tab
- **Root Cause**: Medication categorization logic didn't exclude `EMISINTERNAL` code system
- **Example**: Status code "C" from `<codeSystem>EMISINTERNAL</codeSystem>` was classified as "Standard Medication"
- **Solution**: Added explicit exclusion for `EMISINTERNAL` codes in medication detection logic
- **Result**: EMIS internal codes (status, dates, etc.) no longer appear as medications
- **User Benefit**: Cleaner results with only actual medications in the medications tab
