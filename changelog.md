- **Built-in Filters**: Analysis of aggregate report criteria
- **Healthcare Metrics**: QOF indicators and quality measurement support
- **Enterprise Reporting**: Multi-organization analysis capabilities

### **üîç Advanced XML Pattern Support**

**Complex Structures:**
- **baseCriteriaGroup**: Nested criterion logic within wrapper criteria
- **Linked Criteria**: Cross-table relationships with temporal constraints
- **Population Criteria**: References between searches and reports
- **EMISINTERNAL Classifications**: Episode types, consultation headings, clinical status
- **Advanced Restrictions**: "Latest N WHERE condition" with test attributes

**Clinical Code Systems:**
- **SNOMED Refsets**: Direct code handling with clean description extraction
- **Legacy Code Mapping**: Backward compatibility with legacy EMIS codes
- **Medication Systems**: SCT_APPNAME, SCT_CONST, SCT_DRGGRP support

### **üì§ Comprehensive Export System (Complete Rebuild)**

**Export Handlers:**
- **Search Export**: Detailed rule analysis with criteria breakdown
- **Report Export**: Type-specific exports for List/Audit/Aggregate reports
- **Clinical Code Export**: Conditional source tracking based on deduplication mode
- **Rule Export**: Individual rule exports with comprehensive analysis

**Export Features:**
- **Multiple Formats**: Excel (multi-sheet), CSV, JSON support

## **Migration Notes**

### **From Previous Version:**
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing XML files continue to work
- **Enhanced Output**: Same clinical codes with additional analysis
- **Preserved Workflows**: Translation functionality remains core feature
- **Extended Capabilities**: All previous features enhanced and expanded

### **New URL:**
- **Live Application**: https://emis-xml-toolkit.streamlit.app/

## **Previous Versions (Historical Reference)**

### **v1.x Series - Foundation Model**
- Simple EMIS GUID to SNOMED translation
- Basic XML parsing and code extraction  
- Single-tab interface with clinical codes only
- CSV export functionality
- MKB lookup table integration

The v1.x series established the foundation but was limited to basic translation and had multiple shortcomings - I was never really happy with it.
v2.0.0 represents a complete evolution into a comprehensive EMIS XML analysis platform.
